# Objective
The goal of this project was to put together all of my React experience into an application that uses client side routing. Using React Router and the FakeStore API, this project has multiple pages common to a webstore. There is a home page, a main page store that lists all of the items, and a cart page that displays the items that the user has added to their cart. Each item has a link to a more detailed item page that is displayed using a dynamic route based on the item's ID.

The responsive design was achieved using CSS modules and utilizes media queries to enable a mobile navigation bar at the appropriate sizes.
